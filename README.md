# Weather App

https://weather-app-umber-eta.vercel.app/

The basic Weather app, that im sure EVERYONE has made.
currently only set to one city.
## About it

 Built with TypeScript

 I'm using the api from VisualCrossing to grab 15 days worth of weather data.
 
 That data is passed to Server2.0, which then builds that data into something more managable.
 
 It's a lot easier to type small objects then someone elses mammoth of an object.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
